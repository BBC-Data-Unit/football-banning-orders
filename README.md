In November 2015 we [reported on a fall in the number of football banning orders issued to badly-behaved fans](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34936495).

The data came from [Home Office statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/football-related-arrests-and-banning-orders-season-2014-to-2015). In this repository we share a link to the original data and to a simplified CSV version of that.
